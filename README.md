The Arduino UNO + CNC shield has been the go-to setup for several CNC machines, robotic arms, drawing machines and what not! It's about time we replace the 8-bit microcontroller, with a powerful 32-bit, Wifi + BLE enabled ESP32!

**Bonus: It's 100% open source, including the PCB layout files!**

This project builds upon pioneering work done by GitHub user [Barton Dring](https://github.com/bdring).

## 3D Model
A 3D model of the PCB can be conveniently viewed in the browser via **CADFlux**.

## Blog
[Here's a short blog on how this board was designed!](https://curiousmotor.com/2021/12/27/designing-the-onyx-v1-0-motherboard/)

## Features

1. Control upto 4 stepper motors
2. Supports all stepper drivers in STEP/DIR mode (A4988, DRV8825, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2130)
3. 5V PWM outputs x 3
4. Limit switch ports x 3 (X, Y and Z Axes)
5. 12/24V input power supply port
6. Wifi + BLE support (Thanks to GRBL_ESP32)
7. MicroSD card Support

## Firmware

Currently the firmware works superb with GRBL_ESP32. We are in the process of adding support for Marlin.

## Hardware

All of the hardware is designed in **KiCAD**. It's a 2 layer PCB the uses all standard components available at JLCPCB. Currently the board only supports stepper drives in STEP/DIR mode, v2 would support SPI and UART as well.

## Current Progress
Onyx V1 has been thoroughly tested with a 'Dremel CNC', and it works like a charm. We are already ideating and working on a much more powerful V2!

## Support and Sponsorship
We believe open source is the future, collaboration over competition. A lot of time and money goes into development and prototyping. If such projects make your work easier, consider '‚≠ê-ing' the repository. (Yes, that's all it takes!)
